## Fruit Calorie Checker  

This simple Python program lets users check the calorie content of specific fruits. When prompted, users can enter a fruit name, and if it matches an item in the predefined list, the program will display its calorie value.  

#### How It Works:  
1. The user is asked, **"What are you thinking of?"**  
2. The input is processed (stripped of extra spaces and converted to lowercase).  
3. The program checks if the fruit is in its database.  
4. If found, it displays the calorie count. Otherwise, it does nothing.  

#### Example Usage:  
- Input: `"Apple"` → Output: `"The value of apple is 130"`  
- Input: `"Banana"` → No output (not in the list).  

Perfect for a quick calorie check on select fruits!
